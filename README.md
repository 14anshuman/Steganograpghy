# Steganograpghy
Project Title:
Data Hiding in Images Using Steganography in Cybersecurity

Description:
This project implements steganography techniques to securely hide sensitive information within digital images. By embedding data into image pixels without significantly altering the visual appearance, it ensures confidentiality and secure communication.

Unique Features:
Secure data concealment using image steganography.
Maintains image integrity without noticeable distortion.
Supports encoding and decoding of hidden messages.
Useful for cybersecurity, digital forensics, and private communication.
Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, OS, String

Usage:
Encoding: Hide a secret message inside an image.
Decoding: Retrieve the hidden message from a steganographic image.
End Users:
Cybersecurity experts
Law enforcement agencies
Privacy-conscious individuals
Digital forensics professionals


Future Enhancements:
Support for multiple file formats (PNG, BMP, JPEG).
Implement cryptographic encryption for added security.
Develop a web-based or desktop GUI application.
